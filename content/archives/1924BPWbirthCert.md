## Notes

*Notes from translator Carole Mullineux:*

{wdl|Q1416453|Pidyon haben}: "The pidyon haben (Hebrew: פדיון הבן‎) or redemption of the first-born (if male and not by caesarean)
is a mitzvah in Judaism whereby a Jewish firstborn son is "redeemed" by use of silver coins from his birth-state of sanctity,
i.e. from being predestined by his firstborn status to serve as a priest."

Judging from the birth certificate I would say that BPW’s parents (Heinrich Wiesner and Paula Kohorn) were indeed observant Jews.
They were part of a Jewish community which had established itself in a country which was, after all, not deemed to be ‘theirs’.
The diaspora had rendered them landless, nationless. So their religion was their unifying bond, their identity.
