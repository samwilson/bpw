EDITOR MEDICAL WORLD:—It has been
twenty-five years since Professor Pancoast
performed the first artificial impregnation
of a woman, in the Sansom Street hospital
of Jefferson Medical College, in Philadelphia.
At that time the procedure was so
novel, so peculiar in its human ethics, that
the six young men of the senior class who
witnest the operation were pledged to absolute
secrecy. The circumstances of the case
were about as follows:

A wealthy merchant of Philadelphia consulted
Professor Pancoast to learn why his
home was childless. The man was forty-one
years of age, of sound body as far as he
knew, had a good family history, and had
never suffered from any serious illness in
his life, barring a slight attack of gonorrhea
in his youth, while sowing the proverbial
“wild oats.”

His wife was ten years his junior, a perfect
picture of health, and a product of one
of the old Quaker families of wealth and
distinction in Quakerville.

An appointment was made with them both
for an examination at the Sansom Street
hospital, and a section of the senior class,
of which I was one, was called upon to
assist the Professor. The supposition on the
part of the Professor was that the woman
was unable to conceive because of some impediment
which possibly might be removed.
Therefore, she was examined first. The
examination was very complete, almost as
perfect as an army examination, but not the
slightest abnormal condition was discovered.
As a matter of possible public interest, I
will say that during this examination was
discovered for the first time, as far as I
know, the suction function of the uterus,
which takes place during orgasm.

The man was then examined; and while
no physical defect was discoverable, the
spermatic fluid was shown by the microscopic
examination to be absolutely void of
spermatozoons. This, of course, cleared up
the situation at once, and the man was informed
that the fault was his, and probably
due to results of the gonorrhea in his youth.
Professor Pancoast at that time considered
the trouble as easily remedied, and began a
course of treatment which he thought
proper.

But after two months’ careful attention,
the man showed no change whatever, and
the Professor then concluded that the pri-
Mary seminal ducts were occluded by the
former inflammation extending upward
from the urethra. A joking remark by one
of the class, “the only solution of this problem
is to call in the hired man,” was the
probable incentiv to the plan of action which
followed. The woman was chloroformed,
and with a hard rubber syringe some fresh
semen from the best-looking member of the
class was deposited in the uterus, and the
cervix slightly plugged with gauze. Neither
the man nor the woman knew the nature of
what had been done at the time, but subsequently
the Professor repented of his action,
and explained the whole matter to the husband.
Strange as it may seem, the man was
delighted with the idea, and conspired with
the Professor in keeping from the lady the
actual way by which her impregnation was
brought about. In due course of time the
lady gave birth to a son, and he had characteristic
features, not of the senior student,
but of the willing but impossible father.

That boy is now a business man of the
city of New York, and I have shaken hands
with him within the past year.

Since then there has been formed an association
for the purpose of producing artificial
impregnation of women who may for
any reason give a written consent to such a
proceeding. From a nature point of view
the idea of artificial impregnation offers
valuable advantages. The mating of human
beings must, from the nature of things, be
a matter of sentiment alone. Persons of the
worst possible promise of good and healthy
offspring are being lawfully united in marriage
every day. Marriage is a proposition
which is not submitted to good judgment or
even common sense, as a rule. No Burbank
methods are possible, even tho they be ideal.
Artificial impregnation by carefully selected
seed, alone will solve the problem. It may
at first shock the delicate sensibilities of the
sentimental who consider that the source
of the seed indicates the true father, but
when the scientific fact becomes known that
the origin of the spermatozoa which generates
the ovum is of no more importance
than the personality of the finger which
pulls the trigger of a gun, then objections
will lose their forcefulness, and artificial impregnation
become recognized as a race-uplifting
procedure.

It is gradually becoming well establisht
that the mother is the complete builder of
the child. It is her blood that gives it material
for its body, and her nerve energy
which is divided to supply its vital force.
It is her mental ideals which go to influence,
to some extent at least, the features, the tendencies,
and the mental caliber of the child.
“Many a man rocks another man’s child
and thinks he is rocking his own,” for it
looks like him. And often two children by
the same parents have features entirely dissimilar.
It is the predominating mental
ideals prevailing with the mother that
shapes the destiny of the child. The man
who thrusts his nose into a beautiful blossom
to surfeit his sense of smell on the
sweet perfume, is merely breathing the lustful
odor from the sexual organ of the
plant; and if his nose displaces some of the
pollen, he may be the father of the next
flower. If a honey bee does the work, it
might be called the father.

A scientific study of sex selection without
regard to marriage conditions, might result
in giving some,men children of wonderful
mental endowments, in place of half-witted,
evil-inclined, disease-disposed offspring
which they are ashamed to call their
own. The mechanical method of impregnation,
whether it be the orthodox way, or the
aseptic surgeon’s skillful fingers, counts but
little, except sentiment, and sentiment is fast
becoming a servant instead of a master in
the affairs of the human race. Few are the
children that are brought intentionally into
this world. As a rule they are but the incidental
result of a journey in search of selfish
pleasure. They are seldom sought, and
often unwelcome when they put in their
first appearance. The subsequent mother’s
love is largely a matter of growth, for affection
is but an attribute of selfishness.

The man who may think this idea shocking,
probably has millions of gonnococci
swarming in his seminal ducts, and probably
his wife has had a laparotomy which nearly
cost her life itself, as a result of his infecting
her with the crop reaped from his last
planting of “wild oats.” One man in every
five in New York City was found to be
free from the contamination of venereal
disease to an extent that rendered him
safe around the house in which a woman
lived.

Go ask the blind children whose eyes were
saturated with gonorrheal pus as they struggled
thru the birth canal to emerge into this
world of darkness to endure a living
death; ask them what is the most shocking
thing in this whole world. Ask Helen
Keller what is the most shocking thing in
this sin-soaked ball of selfish pursuits. They
will tell you it is the idea that man, wonderful
man, is infecting 80 percent of all
womankind with the satanic germs collected
by him as his youthful steps wandered in
the “bad lands.”
