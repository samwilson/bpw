title: Research and career

Most of the following research and information about BPW’s work in the field of female
reproduction was compiled by David Hall ( Emeritus Professor of community paediatrics at the
Institute of General Practice and Primary Care, University of Sheffield) in 2023. The original
document is also available as File:Wiesner pathway as pioneer v2.pdf. His comments are included.
David wanted to find out exactly how BPW’s research on sex hormones may have laid the
foundations and consequently contributed to the development of oral contraception and HRT. He
writes: “It has not been an easy investigation. I have now been able to obtain most of the key
papers except for one (or possibly two) dating from what were presumably Wiesner’s
“postgraduate” student projects, as so far the journal abbreviations do not match any available
journal. Assuming that the dates I have found are correct, there was a remarkably rapid progression
from his work in Vienna (reported in 1925 so probably done in 1923 or 1924) to being recruited to
Edinburgh in 1928. There would not have been any slick abstracting systems like those we have
now, but of course there were far fewer scientific journals circulating at the time, so perhaps it was
not too difficult to keep up with research results from other academic centres like Vienna.”
The first paper that is referenced is in 1928, from work probably done while he was still in Vienna:
In Nature March 31 1928: 121:3048, 498-9. Wiesner states that he was “the first to demonstrate
that pregnancy could be interrupted by injection of the “oestrous” hormone.” (Biol Ges zu Wien,
December 7th 1925 ref. Is still elusive), and he refers to work by Steinach, Heinlein and Wiesner
(Pflugers Arch 1925, ccx 598), using material derived from that work. This work is referenced by
Allen and Doisy (Ovarian and placental hormones: Physiol Reviews October 1, 1927.).

In 1928, BPW was appointed to the position of head of Sex Physiology by animal geneticist
Francis Crew, Professor of Animal Genetics at the newly established Institute of Animal Genetics
(IAG) within the University of Edinburgh. (In 1920 Sharpey-Schafer had approached Francis Crew,
asking him to run the newly created animal breeding research station in Edinburgh, and in 1928
Crew was created the first Professor of Animal Genetics at the University of Edinburgh: known as
the Buchanan chair, it was indirectly funded by the Rockefeller Foundation). A new building on the
Kings Buildings site was then set up, opening in 1930, and this is where BPW worked. At the same
time, the Department became an integral part of the University with a new Animal Breeding
Committee advising on the management of the Department. Under Crew's leadership, research in
the fields of reproductive physiology and genetics was encouraged to develop side by side as a facet
of scientific animal breeding. It is worth noting that a number of notable scientists conducted
research at the IAG, including physiologist John Scott Haldane, zoologist Lancelot Hogben and
evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley. It was there that BPW built upon the work of Zondek and
Ascheim by examining the production and role of hormones during fertilization and pregnancy.
Zondek and Aschheim had thought that the hormone chorionic gonadotrophin was produced by the
putuitary gland, but the research conducted at the IAG proved that it is secreted by the placenta.
In 1929 Crew and BPW created a Pregnancy Diagnosis Laboratory, which by 1939 was conducting
ten thousand pregnancy tests per year, testing samples sent by medical practitioners or private
individuals from all over the UK. This Laboratory was the first of its kind in Britain and was set up
under Crew as a tangential area of public benefit, linked to their research at the Institute. Crew
reported on the first year of the service in the BMJ (1930, April 5, 662-3), writing: “…. a year ago
my colleague Dr. B. P. Wiesner convinced me that for several reasons it was desirable to examine
on a large scale the pregnancy diagnosis tool of Zondek and Aschheim. It was out of this suggestion
that the Pregnancy Diagnosis Station/Laboratory emerged, the conduct of which has very largely
been in hands of Dr. E. M. Robertson,. working under the supervision of Dr. Wiesner.” (Lancet
1928 ii 834 ‘Diagnosis of early pregnancy’ by RW Johnstone (Gynaecology Dept, Edinburgh
University)

What was known about female hormones around the time BPW started his lab career? The earliest
report appears in Fosbery W.H.: (Severe climacteric flushings successfully treated with ovarian
extract. BMJ. 1897;1:1039). In 1903 Ludwig Fraenkel (Archiv für Gynäkologie, 1903) had become
the first person to describe the human corpus luteum, a glandular mass found in the ovaries of a
female during menstruation that has important endocrine functions. Fraenkel also named the
hormone progesterone (which the corpus luteum secretes in addition to oestrogen): “The function
of the corpus luteum: From the year 1901 I reported on experiments which revealed the previously
unknown function of the corpus luteum. …. The late Breslau embryologist Gustav Born proposed…
that the corpus luteum verum graviditatis mass, according to its structure and development, is a
gland with internal secretion, equipped with the function of causing the settlement and development
of the fertilized egg in the uterus.” In 1923, Edgar Allen, a reproductive physiologist, was studying
the role of follicular fluids obtained from the ovary of sows on uterine weight, vaginal maturation,
and sexual receptivity. Allen provided follicular fluid from sows and Doisy purified the estrogenic
activity. The biologic endpoint, uterine weight, was later called the Allen-Doisy test. (Purification
of oestrogen, involving three key investigators, Edgar Allen, Edward Doisy, and Adolph
Butenandt. ) Meanwhile, Selmar Aschheim and Bernard Zondek, working in Germany,
demonstrated large amounts of estrogenic activity in the urine of pregnant women. With this
biological material as a source, Doisy crystallized estrone : “the potency of these crystals is so great
that one gram could restore the sex cycle in more than nine million rats” (1929).
In Nature March 23 1929: page 449: the “alpha- hormone” labelled Oestrin was described. BPW
then developed the role of the “beta -hormone” and set out the experimental basis for a second
hormone (this is probably the same as that which Fraenkel had categorised as progesterone). In
1930, in the Edinburgh Medical Journal, 37:2, 73, he presented a paper on the separation of the
“kyogenic” hormone from human placenta (? = progesterone). He had a paper in The Eugenics
Review (1930 22: 19-26) regarding hormones and control of the reproductive system. This clarified
the current state of knowledge, and also emphasised differences between experimental animals such
as mice and primates including humans. “…There are at least two such hormones and they are, in
mouse and rat, liberated in succession. During the first phase of ovarian secretion, which precedes
ovulation, oestrin is produced. …. Its injection into ovariotomized mice, in which no sex cycle
occurs in the absence of any ovarian hormone, causes the complete series of the oestrous changes.
The animals mate under its influence and also display the anatomical conditions of oestrus. During
the second phase of ovarian secretion which follows ovulation there is produced another ovarian
hormone, kythin or progestin, which is responsible for the changes in the uterus permissive of
pregnancy development”.

Crew and Wiesner jointly published in the BMJ, 777, in 1930, regarding the existence of a pituitary
hormone that regulates thyroid production of thyroxine; now known as TSH – thyroid stimulating
hormone. In 1931 they elegantly discussed previous experiments and their own, regarding the
question of whether the pituitary produces one or two hormones that regulate the sex hormones
oestrogen and progesterone, correctly concluding that there are two (these pituitary hormones are
now known to be FSH – follicle stimulating hormone; LH – luteinizing hormone: Proc Roy Soc
Edin 50: 79-103).

Zondek and Aschheim had thought that the hormone chorionic gonadotrophin was produced by the
pituitary gland. But the research conducted at the IAG proved that it is secreted by the placenta.
Some notes taken from an email from Jesse Olszynko-Gryn include comments from Francis Crew
regarding his association with BPW: “I introduced a section of endocrinology, and I got a man
called Bertold Wiesner from Vienna to come and help me – a very bright young man, Viennese,
more artist than scientist, if you can distinguish between the two, I don’t think there’s much
difference between the two – and he did some really first-class work. Amongst other things, he
helped me – or I helped him, I suppose I should say – to organise a Pregnancy Diagnosis Station,
the first in this country. Yes, there was quite a lot of rat work done. Wiesner was the rat man really,
rat and mouse, I worked on the fowl, ageing and things like that. Wiesner wasn’t really interested in
either animal genetics or animal breeding, he was interested in pure physiology, endocrinology, I
mean he was purely...and his interests were not aligned in any way with ours. So that I wasn’t
particularly happy to see the development take that particular line and I wasn’t very unhappy when
it came to an end, because I couldn’t see where it was going at all. It was more, far more
appropriate to a department of obstetrics or physiology. Although I wanted reproductive physiology,
I did want it to have some, not direct, but some bearing upon problems of the animal breeders, I
mean, twinning in sheep or cattle or something of that sort.’'
The following references in the British Medical Journal relate to BPW’s work during those years in
Edinburgh: Wiesner: BMJ 1931, 860 (2nd year, including a discussion of false positive and false
negative results and communications with Dr Aschheim); Wiesner: BMJ 1932, 759 (3rd year; more
data, other test options, also a reference to possibility of preventing spontaneous abortion in Lancet
3rd Sept p.509 1932); Wiesner: BMJ 1933, 296 (4th year) – More data, with improved accuracy.
“This year's " errors " again contain several cases in which a "negative" diagnosis with definite
clinical signs of pregnancy was followed by spontaneous abortion. The data are now sufficiently
numerous to justify more detailed investigation; this is now in progress, and the results will be
published shortly.” (Aschheim and Zondek had developed the A-Z test; a substance present only in
the urine of pregnant women could elicit a measurable response; injection of a woman’s urine into
an immature female mouse makes a young mouse will go into heat. The substance was actually

In 1929, BPW visited Montreal, where he discussed with some scientists the possibility of using
medicine derived from female hormones to delay menopause. Subsequently, the scientists helped
form the company Ayerst, McKenna and Harrison, Ltd (later, Wyeth) who marketed Premarin, a
controversial hormone replacement therapy (HRT) drug based on pregnant mare's urine. (The
following comment is from David Hall with some unanswered questions regarding this visit: “I
have not yet found any documentary evidence of this/these visits – maybe via company records? Did
he see the full commercial potential for HRT and Oral contraception? Did he invest in the company
/ companies?”)

BPW’s post in Edinburgh was apparently funded or part-funded by an anonymous donor in
Canada. This funding ceased in 1934 and the University was unable or unwilling to maintain his
post. Crew wrote a long paper in 1939 on pregnancy tests but BPW is not a co-author nor is there
any reference to him. It seems as if he did not produce much in the way of ground-breaking
research during the period 1933-1939, possibly due to personal/family reasons. His name re-
appears in papers co-authored with Mary Barton, from the early 1940’s and it is possible that he
also co-authored several published papers with John Yudkin and other colleagues.
David Hall writes that BPW “was obviously not by any means the only scientist working in this
field, but his lab work and his clear analysis of his own and others’ data confirms his status as an
important contributor on the distinction and relationships between the various hormones. So far, it
has been impossible to work out just how many of his insights were entirely original. His work with
the pregnancy testing station was also valuable both as a practical service to women and in setting
baseline standards for future pregnancy diagnostic services; his analysis of false positive and false
negative results was vital in developing and sustaining the service – for which a charge was of
course made and no doubt supported the other work of the organisation”.

While he was still working at the Institute of Animal Genetics, BPW resumed his earlier research
into the prevention of pregnancy which probably contributed to the formulation of a reliable oral
contraceptive for women. In addition, he collaborated with Kenneth Walker, a urological surgeon at
the Royal Northern Hospital, where they had some success in artificially inseminating women with
sperm from anonymous donors in cases where the patient's husband was either impotent or infertile.
At the same time, Mary Barton (an obstetrician working at the Royal Free Hospital in London) had
also had success with using artificial insemination with a few patients. In 1945, BPW collaborated
with Kenneth Walker and Mary Barton on a paper for the British Medical Journal, describing their
technique of human artificial insemination. This publication led to a very public condemnation from
the Archbishop of Canterbury, who wanted to make artificial insemination illegal, calling it ‘the
work of the devil’. In fact, the law was ambiguous and consequently the work of Barton and
Wiesner continued in secrecy, and their patients were counselled to tell nobody about their
treatment (quite possibly a number of women did not fully understand the procedure.
BPW and Mary Barton had married in 1943 and they ran her fertility clinic in London together for
the next 20 years until he retired. It is estimated that she (or they) successfully inseminated at least
1500 women. Ostensibly, the sperm donations were anonymous or at least unidentified, and the
patients were only told that the donor would be a professional man who had already had at least one
child, but in fact DNA evidence shows that the majority of the sperm was provided by BPW
himself, and perhaps about 200 donations came from the neuroscientist Derek Richter. Jonathan, his
son, underwent DNA testing in 2007 which provided a basis for identification. As of 2025, more
than 50 confirmed offspring of BPW have been definitely identified. We do not know exactly how
many donor conceived children were born as all the clinic records were destroyed. In their 1945
paper in the British Medical Journal, Barton and fellow authors Walker and Wiesner explained that
they used a "small panel of donors" that they considered of "intelligent stock". It is unclear whether
Barton knew (at that time at least) that much of the sperm used came from her husband. She kept
records of donors identified only with code names. Documentary filmmaker Barry Stevens, (who
was responsible, with David Gollanz, for finding out about the large number of sperm donations
made by BPW) has stated: "it's possible he didn't tell his wife and she believed the donations were
coming from a lot of different men", as it seems that BPW was the person mainly responsible for
recruiting donors for the clinic. At that time, they would have assumed that after the destruction of
the clinic's records, the parentage of the children conceived at the clinic would be untraceable. They
could not have foreseen the implications of the discovery of DNA, let alone the impact of direct to
consumer DNA testing. Regardless, as a scientist specialising in fertility (among other areas), BPW
should certainly have been aware that there were genetic risks created by his fathering so many
children.

The following table shows some (if not all) the papers that Mary Barton and BPW jointly published
from 1945 to 1952:
