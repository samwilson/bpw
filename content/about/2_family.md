Carole M. translated the certificate and comments:
"The 'pidyon haben' or redemption of the first-born son is a mitzvah in Judaism
whereby a Jewish firstborn son is "redeemed" by use of silver coins from his birth-state of sanctity,
i.e. from being predestined by his firstborn status to serve as a priest.

"Judging from the birth certificate I would say that BPW’s parents (Heinrich Wiesner and Paula
Kohorn) were indeed observant Jews. They were part of a Jewish community which had
established itself in a country which was, after all, not deemed to be ‘theirs’. The diaspora had
rendered them landless, nationless. So their religion was their unifying bond, their identity."

His parents were both of Czech origin. His father, Heinrich Wiesner, was born on June 3, 1867 in
Damborice, south east of Brno, and there is a large Jewish cemetery above the town with a number
of Wiesner graves. Later they moved to Bučovice, an hour’s train ride to the east of Brno, which
was a little bigger than Damborice but still very rural. Heinrich’s parents, Samuel Leopold
Wiesner and Katerina Morawetz, (who are buried in the peaceful and overgrown cemetery in
Bučovice had 8 other children, all of whom apart from Heinrich
and Siegmund were born in Bučovice. We don’t know much about the daily life of the family,
although Samuel was an active leader of the Bučovice Jewish population. There was a large
synagogue which was only demolished in the early 1960’s and the name of Wiesner occurs in some
documentation which can be seen in the entrance lobby of the cemetery.

There were eight siblings in the family; Heinrich was the oldest son.
After him came Sigmund, born on 30 November 1868. He married Henriette Jindriska (‘Jetty’) and
they had one daughter, Katerine. He was murdered in Terezin (Theresienstadt) on 25 October 1942.
Jetty was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943. Katerine was murdered in Terezin in 1942
at the age of 38.

His brother Julius Wiesner was born on 4 August 1870, and married Olga Tausikova on 1
September 1901. They had two children and lived in Prague at Waldhauserova 10. He was
transported to Terezin and then murdered in Auschwitz in 1942 ( Ref: Transport AA 138 Prague-
Terezin, 06/07/1942; Transport 789 Terezin-Auschwitz 26/10/1942). Olgo died in Terezin in 1942.
His sister, Ernestinn was born in 1872 but we don’t know where or when she died.
His next brother Benjamin Johann was born on 29 January 1874 and he was murdered in Treblinka
on 19 September 1942.

Next came Matilde Machle, born in 1877. We know nothing about her life (as yet).
His sister, Bertha Breindel, was born in 1879. She married a Mr. S. Palek, and died in 1916 in
Vienna.

Next came Ella Lea Wiesner who was born on 4 December 1882. She married a Mr. Arnstein; they
had two sons (Gerhult, b. 1906, d.1976, and Stefan, b. 1908, d.1988 who had a son called
Gustavo). Ella was murdered at the Jungfernhot death camp, in Riga, Latvia in January 1942 at the
age of 59.

Jekla Lea Wiesner was born in 1882 but we have no other details about her life.
In 1887, Heinrich married Paula Kohorn in Stedra, West Bohemia, Czechoslovakia (south west of
Karlovy Vary and Mariánské Lázně), which is now a small village but was then a thriving town
with a number of rural based industries.

Paula’s father, Karl Kohorn, came from a family of 9 children: he was born in 1844. Her mother,
Anna Goldman Kohorn, was born in 1855 in Brlozec, a small hamlet a few kilometres to the east of
Stedra. Karl was the Imperial Postmaster in Stedra, and they lived at House number 47, which was
and still is attached to the north end of Stedra Castle. They had four children, all of whom were
born in Stedra.

Paula was the oldest in the Kohorn family; the second child, Adele was born in 1877, and she
married Dr. Emmanuel Deutsch. They had two daughters, Lili (b. 1905, she married Michael
Rabinovitch and they had one daughter Ruth who was born in 1940) and then Amelie (b. 1909, d.
1975 in Israel). Adele died in 1918, possibly of the so-called ‘Spanish flu’.

Hugo was Paula’s only brother. He was born in 1878 and became a lawyer, living in Vienna until
just before the war when BPW helped him escape to Britain. He lived the last years of his life
mostly on Skye at the Wiesner/Barton family home, Corrie Lodge just outside Broadford on Skye,
and Jonathan remembers Uncle Hugo with great affection. He did not marry. Ida was the youngest
of the family. She was born in 1881 and was murdered in Terezin in 1944. She had one daughter,
Marianne Koller.

Paula and Heinrich had two children, Bertold and Katerina (“Kitty”) who was born on
June 28, 1902. We don’t know what led them to move to Austria from Czechoslovakia, and we have no
information about their lives before the First World War, but they must have moved to Marchegg
before 1901, as BPW was born there. During the war it appears that Heinrich was a nurse or
hospital orderly, as a postcard from him (showing him on the front row, second from left) says:
"Here are the sick from my room. Reserve hospital. Abt VII Bezirk II Zim(m)er St Pölten" (Abt. =
Abteilung = Department, Bezirk is the district), in which he is wearing a white coat like the other
Nursing Staff. It's written in the old Kurrentschrift, the handwriting which was used till World War
Two.

In 1919 they were living in a large house at the edge of Marchegg
but although at that time he was described as an 'Agent' working in Vienna 111 (as
shown on the enrolment card for BPW’s enrolment card for the second semester of the University
of Vienna). It is likely that he was a merchant (or Agent) trading in grains and possibly also
livestock and horses.

Sadly, Paula died on February 22, 1920 when BPW was 19 years old, and his sister Kitty was 18.
They were then looked after by their maternal Uncle Hugo. Heinrich re-married and died in
Vienna on July 26, 1924; he is buried at the old cemetery but in the Christian section. Paula is
buried in the Jewish section of the same cemetery and the grave headstone shows the names of both
her parents, Karl and Anna Kohorn.
