title: Education in Austria
---

This next section includes BPW’s education in Austria, his move to Britain in 1928, and details of
his travels during the period 1928-1933. It also includes the letters that his department head in
Edinburgh, Professor Crew, wrote to the Home Office in support on his ongoing residency in
Scotland and also includes a document referring to Anna Wiesner and her activities in Scotland
during that period, which is relevant to his application for permanent residency. Also included is a
record of BPW’s work in his field of reproductive and hormone therapy (as much as we know).
(NOTE: The documents shown in this section pertaining to BPW’s academic career and life in
Austria were all translated professionally by Carole M. and some of her comments are also
included)
In 1919, BPW matriculated from the Imperial and Royal Maximilian High School of Vienna. This is
a translation of his Certificate of Qualification for University Entrance:
“Berthold Paul Wiesner
Born 24 July 1901 in Marchegg, of the Mosaic Religion.
In the Imperial and Royal Maximilian High School of Vienna he began his studies, progressed and
completed them.
In compliance with the Ministerial Regulation of 29 February 1908 Z.10051 (M-V-Bl no.18) he sat
the qualifying examination for university entrance.
His examination results are evidence that he has attained the standard required.

[From Carole M.:“Across the certificate is half-heartedly stamped the word ‘Deutschoesterreich’
(part of the word is very faint because the stamp hasn’t been adequately inked, I’m not surprised).
I daresay whoever applied it did so with a heavy heart though not a heavy hand. From Austro-
Hungarian Empire to German-Austria! What pain that would have caused. I notice the school is
still referred to as ‘k.k. Maximilian gymnasium’ – kaiserlich und koeniglich – imperial and royal -
even though the empire is no more. All the accoutrements of empire were now lost, even the
elevating terminology would have to go in due course. It had no meaning now.
All that suffering on the Eastern Front, all for nothing. Particularly hard to endure for those who
had fought, or who had family or friends who’d fought. I remember Heinrich’s messages to Paula
when he assures her he’s having an easy time of it, and ‘all’s quiet’. ‘Keep cheerful’, he said. I
think he wrote one of those messages just before the Brusilov Offensive.]

In 1921 BPW became a full citizen of Austria, possibly in order to expedite his studies at the
University. The citizenship document reads:
Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications 16-777-1921 Department of the Interior
In accordance with S.8 of the ratified implementations of the State Government of 20 August 1920,
ST.G.B. Nr. 397, it is hereby acknowledged that: Mr Berthold Wiesner Born 24th July 1901
Birthplace: Vienna (Lower Austria)
Profession: Student Place of Origin of Nationality: Damboritz, Moravia, has in line with
Article 90 of the State Treaty of St Germain-en-Laye of 10th September 1919 (ST.G.B. N…..anno

He then began studying at the University of Vienna as shown by enrolment documents from the
period. For example, on August 8 1922 his course of study included Experimental Zoology, Use of
Instruments and Practicals. (PHOTO: Ref 1922 National Enrolment card).
In 1923 his enrolment document reads as follows:

(It is perhaps worth noting that in his enrolment document for the 5th semester he stated his religion
as “‘mosaisch”) .
(PHOTO ref BPW 6th semester enrolment)
In April 1923, he writes to the University regarding his dissertation as follows -
To the Highly Esteemed Professors of the University of Vienna.
The presenting student requests permission to undertake rigorous examination for his doctorate in
the eighth semester of his Philosophical Studies in Zoology combined with Botany. He submits
herewith the following documents: Report book; matriculation certificate; certificate of citizenship;
birth certificate; curriculum vitae; two examples of dissertation work. BPW Wipplingerstrasse,
Vienna.
Papers attached hereto.

(Notes about the above from Carole M.:
Wipplingerstrasse was the address where Paula received her messages from Heinrich when he was
away on the Eastern Front - those messages where he was determined to sound so upbeat while
witnessing such horrors. I remember how he exhorted her to ‘stay cheerful’. I seem to remember
that one postcard was written about the time of the Russian offensive against the thinly-stretched
Austro-Hungarian troops in the summer of 1916. Wipplingerstrasse was also the address of Dr
Hugo Kohorn, Paula’s brother — is it possible they were staying with him?”
(PHOTO ref Examination for Doctorate of Bertold Wiesner (letter)
In April 1923, the appraisal of his dissertation reads as follows:
“Statement by Hans Przibram dated 23 April, 1923.
Appraisal of Dissertation submitted by Phil. Candidate Berthold P. Wiesner In the work he has
submitted: ‘Ovarian Transplantation in the Brown Rat’, Herr Berthold Wiesner has demonstrated
that the ovaries of a brown rat can be removed and placed in a young female of the same species
who has had her ovaries taken out. Ovarian function can subsequently resume in the transplanted
organ. The technique applied in this procedure is one which the candidate has himself selected, and
which might be termed autophoric in that there is no exertion of pressure or any injury beyond a
clean incision. The uterus is cut open and the replacement ovary is introduced. This will be
subjected to upwards pressure by uterine peristalsis, but can be prevented from displacement by
suture. Surgical transplant methods present many diverse problems to which solutions must be
found which can ultimately enable full function of the retained ovary. A method of experiment
involved the implantation of ovaries of heterozygous dark brown rats into albino rats which were
then covered by albino males, thereby begetting a ‘medium dark’ animal. An obstacle to the
transplant research was the difficulty in obtaining freshly extracted ovaries and transplanting them
without delay into the newly-spayed female. This piece of work demonstrates a sound
understanding of anatomical structure, how to identify problems and develop appropriate means of
overcoming them. There is an abundance of research literature quoted, but it would have been an
improvement had the dates of publication been included.”

On May 1923 he was awarded his doctorate, a very impressive document which reads, again in
translation:

[From C.M.:As you can see, some questions have not been answered. The query about legal
guardian would only apply to a minor. But other required information is absent.I wasn’t sure how to
translate ‘mosaisch’ – the religion based on the Laws of Moses. Is it the Creed of Moses? I think it
was an archaic term by the 20th century, so I don’t know why BPW used it. Maybe with the rise of
anti-Semitism at that time he felt understandably uneasy, so sought to avoid use of the word
‘Jewish’. He appears to have been closest to Professors Przibram and Hatschek, who were both
Jewish. The former died in a concentration camp. No, let’s be more direct, he was slaughtered in
one. Professor Hatschek was an inspirational figure – there is information about him online. He
was ejected from his position by the Nazis, and his property was stolen. Maybe BPW preferred the
term ‘mosaisch’ because he could always argue that Christianity includes the Ten Commandments.]
This is his I.D. in 1923 (PHOTO ref University of Vienna I.D. card) and the following year his
enrolment card is shown : (PHOTO ref BPW University of Vienna enrolment certificate 1924)
Once BPW had graduated, his curriculum vitae read:
Curriculum Vitae
I, the undersigned, was born 24th July 1901, in Marchegg in Lower Austria. I was born in that very
place as the son of Heinrich Wiesner, agriculturist. I became by right a citizen of the State of
Austria.† Between 1911 and 1919 I completed my studies at the Classical Grammar School
(Grammar School of the Union, Vienna IX). I then pursued studies in the philosophy of science‡
for a period of eight semesters at Vienna University. I had the honour of studying under Herr
Dozenten, Professors Hatschak, Przibram, Joseph, Grobben, Werner, Wettstein, Molisch – they were
all my tutors. Since the year 1921 I have carried out research in the Biology Department of the
Faculty of Science, in the disciplines of both Zoology and Physiology.
[Notes from Carole M.: There is no name on the sheet of paper, and no signature.
† State of Austria — I take it that BPW is referring to the fact that he became an Austrian citizen
following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918 and the subsequent establishment of
the Republic of Austria.]
‡ Philosophy of Science — in this context, philosophy means ‘learning, acquiring knowledge’.
