title: Emigration to the UK
---

On March 26, 1928, BPW arrived in Britain with Anna and Eva (aged three) to take up his position
at Edinburgh University (PHOTO ref: BPW and family, 1928 Embarcation and Immigration form).
At the end of 1928 we can see a copy of a minute from the Board of Agriculture of Scotland, which
refers to their request to the Under Secretary of State asking to extend BPW’s residency (due to the
value of his work there). The memo also refers to Anna’s involvement with the miners Unions in
the Central Belt of Scotland:
The Under Secretary of State:
The Board approached the University confidentially on this matter and they had a call today from
Mr. Miles (President of the Royal College of Surgeons) who is Chairman of the Committee of the
University Court which looks after the Animal Breeding Department, and Mr. Fleming, the
Secretary of the University.
Mr. Miles explained that Dr. Wiesner was doing unique work of first class importance. He had made
in Germany an independent chemical discovery the results of which he had applied to animals in
Edinburgh with success. This success was now being confirmed by preliminary observations on the
human subject and most important results may be obtained if success is fully established.
In Mr. Miles’ opinion, Dr. Wiesner cannot be replaced. The chemical knowledge required for the
work now proceeding is his alone. If he were withdrawn from this work the results of nine months’
valuable and expensive work would be lost. Mr. Miles is satisfied that the University representation
would definitely be in favour of his services being retained.
It was further suggested that if it would help matters at all, the Principal, Mr. Miles, Secretary, or
some influential representative of the University would be prepared to see Mrs. Wiesner with a view
to inducing her to cease the association which she has formed.

We also have a report referring to Anna’s involvement in more detail, and is included here as it
also mentions BPW’s previous and highly regarded work in Austria :
“Anna Wilmenia Wiesner
Austrian, born Vienna 16th March, 1908. Holder of Austrian passport No. 342593, issued at Vienna
4.4.28. Wife of Dr. Bertold Paul WIESNER, Austrian, born at Marchegg, Austria on 24th July,
1901.
This woman, who was formerly resident at 24, Eschenalle, Berlin, landed at Leith on 24.5.28. Her
husband, who had landed at Harwich on the 26th March, 1928, is in charge of the Animal Research
Department of Edinburgh University. In September, 1928, it was ascertained that Mrs. Wiesner had
been in the company of Communists in the mining district of Lochgelly. Ostensibly she was writing
a book on mining conditions in this country, based on personal observation. She did in fact visit the
Jenny Gray Pit, Lochgelly, and the Lochore Colliery. She gave out that she was interested in mining
and would like to see the underground workings. She was taken down a pit and asked about the
main roads. She asked about the coal cutting machines and also if they had any other machines. She
wished to see the coal face, but as no miners were there she was not taken and she enquired as to the
number of shafts or outlets there were at the pit. When asked whether she had been down any other
pits she said she had been down several in the Lothians - Lady Victoria, newton Grange, Rosslyn
Colliery and one near Cramond Bridge. On the occasion of her visits to the Jenny Gray Pit,
Lochgelly, and the Lochore Colliery she was accompanied by two individuals well known as
associates of Communists.

In October, 1928, it was definitely ascertained that Mrs. Wiesner was in direct touch with David
Ramsay, the District Organiser of the Communist Party in Glasgow, and with F. Douglas, a Communist, of Edinburgh,
regarding the setting up of Miners’ Relief Committees under the auspices of the Workers’
International Relief. Confirmed proof of her participation in this work can be produced if necessary.
Other enquiries that have been made can be produced if necessary.
Other enquiries that have been made have established that Dr Wiesner is a well known chemist,
who for some time worked as assistant to the well known professor, Dr. Steinach. He has frequently
lectured in Vienna on rejuvenation and heredity and bears a good name in scientific circles. He is
considered to be a hard working and clever chemist and there is a rumour abroad that he intends to
emigrate to Australia. He is a Social Democrat who takes little or no interest in politics, having
devoted his whole time to chemical research. Mrs. Wiesner, on the other hand, is known in her
native country to be politically very Left. It has not, however, been established whether she is
actually a member of the Austrian or German Communist Parties.”

After taking up his position in Edinburgh, BPW travelled in and out of the UK a number of times:
the following photos/scans show some of his entries and exits:
9 January 1929 (PHOTO ref: BPW landing at Harwich, 9 January 1929),
6 April, 1929: (PHOTO ref: Aliens Branch file for BPW and Anna Gmeyer)
Next we see a list of his travels from 1929 to 1934, as shown by the stamps in his passport. It is
possible that he was in Canada and the United States to liase with laboratories there but we have no
actual record of why he went there and who he visited.

He did not have permanent residency in Britain for the first three years after he arrived in
Edinburgh, and the Department of Genetics wrote to the Home Office a number of times in order to
request extensions to his visa as shown in the following letters:
March 27th 1930.
University of Edinburgh King’s Buildings, West Mains Road.
Sir,
It is required of me formally to state that I wish to obtain permission from the Under Secretary of
State for Dr. B. P. Wiesner, an assistant in this Department, to remain in this country for a further
period of time. He is in charge of a section in this Department, and I could not possibly replace him
at the present time. His work has been the means of attracting a very considerable amount of
attention, and also endowment, to this Department, and his conduct during the past year has been
entirely satisfactory.
I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant,
Signed F.A.E. Crew
To: The Under Secretary of State, Home Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.1.
(PHOTO ref: Dept of Genetics to Under Sec of State 1930)
The following year, Dr Crew writes to the Home Office again:
Department of Animal Genetics, King’s Buildings West Main Road ,Edinburgh.
March 24th 1931.
Sir,
I beg to enclose herewith the passport of Dr. B.P. Wiesner. Dr. Wiesner is a senior member of the
staff of this Department, and his services to the Department, and to the University, with which we
are closely associated, have become indispensable. His work is of such high standing that it would
seriously embarrass our activities were he obliged to leave, and I therefore beg leave to request that
his period of residence in this country be prolonged indefinitely.
I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant,
(signed) F.A.E. Crew
The Under Secretary of State, Home Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.1.
(PHOTO ref: Dept of Genetics to Under Sec of State 1931)
In 1932, Dr Crew writes again, this time requesting an indefinite stay for BPW:
Institute of Animal Genetics, King’s Buildings, West Mains Road, Edinburgh.
3rd February 1932
The Under Secretary of State, Home Office, London, S.W.1.
Sir,
I wish to apply on behalf of Dr. B.P. Wiesner for an extension of his sojourn in this country. It can
be said of Dr. Wiesner that he attracted to this institute the endowment from which his own salary is
derived. Furthermore out of this endowment the salaries and wages of over a dozen people of
British nationality are provided. Mr. T.B. Macaulay who gave this endowment to the University of
Edinburgh is particularly interested in the work that Dr. Wiesner himself is doing and there is no
doubt that if Dr. Wiesner were to leave Macaulay’s interests in this institute would diminish if not
cease.
I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant

(signed) F.A.E. Crew

On September 14 1933, BPW applied for naturalisation and placed a notice in The Scotsman.
(PHOTO ref: BPW naturalisation application, PHOTO ref: Naturalisation notice in The Scotsman)
His naturalisation was granted on 30 August 1934 . We don’t have a copy of the actual certificate
but the reference is as follows: Reference: HO 334/226/367 , Description: Naturalisation
Certificate: Bertold Paul Wiesner. From Austria. Resident in Edinburgh. Wife's name Unspecified
[Wiesner]. Children: Eva Maria Charlotte Michele Wiesner. Home Office Reference: W 351.
Certificate BZ367 issued 30 August 1934. In that year, 1934, he was still having to apply to the
Home Office for permission to stay in the UK for his daughter Eva, and the transcription reads:
Name of Alien in full: WIESNER Berthold Paul . Aliens Naturalization. Fee W351/2. MINUTES:

(Carole M. comments: The position of divorce in Austria is peculiar. Prior to the present regime it
was the case, according to the information given us by the Austrian legislature, that where the
divorce is not final and is a separation, its parties unless there were faults were urged to remarry.
In response it would not be just to refuse naturalisation in this case. Gibberish – appalling
grammar and scant knowledge of the then legal position concerning divorce in Austria. This was
in July 1934. In fact, in 1783 Joseph II, who was a reforming Emperor, had made it legal for
couples to divorce by mutual agreement provided they were not Catholic and had not married in
Church. This was effectively separating Church marriages from State civil marriages. Joseph II
was known as a monarch of the Enlightenment – his many reforms included permitting schools for
the children of Jewish families, and other schools for those of minority groups. The legislation
regarding marriage did not change till 1938 and the Anschluss, when German law prevailed.
